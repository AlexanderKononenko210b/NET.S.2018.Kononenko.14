1. Develop a class to simulate a clock with a countdown that implements the capability after the assigned time (waiting time is granted to the class by the user) to transmit a message and additional information about the event to any subscriber who subscribes to the event. Provide the possibility of subscribing to an event in several classes. Demonstrate the operation of the class in the console application. [watch here]()

2. Implement a generalized binary search algorithm. Develop unit-tests. [watch here]()

3. Implement the method-generator of a sequence of Fibonacci numbers. Develop unit-tests. [watch here]()

4. Develop a generic typed Queue collection class that implements the basic operations for working with the queue, and provides the ability to iterate through it, implementing the iterator "manually" (without using the yield iterator). Test the methods of the developed class. [watch here]()
